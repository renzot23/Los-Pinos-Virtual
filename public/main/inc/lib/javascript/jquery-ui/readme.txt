Important Notice

If you want to change the jquery-ui CSS files you *must* edit the jquery-ui/default.css file. 
This file is loaded after the jquery-ui/xxx/jquery-ui-1.8.X.custom.css

Don't modify the CSS files of the jquery-ui themes because when a new version is released we will override those changes.
